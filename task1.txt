A Genre, or film genre, is a way to categorize films and TV shows based on similar plot elements, directing styles, or themes. They are a way for producers to tell the audience what to expect from the film and what it will contain. There are many different genres, which can in turn be broken down into various sub-genres, for example fiction can be divided into sci-fi, fantasy, historical fiction, and many more. Here are some of the more common and well-known genres in the film industry:
  •	What makes a film an action film is a matter of debate. For the most part, a film that features large amounts of stunts, explosions, fights, and chase scenes is categorized as part of the action genre
  •	The comedy genre emphasizes humour, with the point of the film being to amuse the audience. Comedies typically (dark comedy is one exception) have happy endings. This genre is one of the oldest genres in film, originating from theatre alongside tragedy.
  •	The romance genre tells stories of romance, passion, emotion, and affectionate romantic involvement. The plot focusses on the main characters of dating or marriage.
  •	The fantasy genre is a category of speculative fiction, usually containing elements of magic, fairytales, and otherworldly wonders. 
  •	Thriller, or suspense thriller, is designed to evoke suspense in the viewer. While suspense is a common tool is most films, here it is the main plot element and tool for evoking emotion. This genre is closely related to, and often confused with, horror.
Unlike genres, there is a set of guidelines for determining the rating of a movie or show. Film ratings are determined by the Motion Picture Association (MPA), previously known as the Motion Picture Association of America. The most common ratings are
  •	Rated G for general audiences
  •	Rated M for mature audiences
  •	Rated PG if parental guidance is advised
  •	Rated R for restricted for person under 16 years
There are also less common or unofficial ratings that are used, although rarely. 
At the end of the day, both of these methods of categorizing exist solely for the benefit of the consumer. It is there to help them find something to watch that is appropriate and liked by them.
